Ever since the Department of Health set the requirement for choking-victim posters in 1978, New York has treated the rule loosely.
Dr. Henry Heimlich's push turned his maneuver into a required public graphic, and the city has spent decades quietly rewriting it through decay, bootlegs, and improvisation.
This project uses those posters as a case study to see how New Yorkers handle public space, read official design, and bend the rules whenever they can. Tap anywhere to begin.
